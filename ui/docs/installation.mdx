# Installation

We will guide you through installation of `wash`, the wasmCloud Shell, which gives you the tools to install, run, and develop with wasmCloud.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="ubuntudebian" label="Ubuntu/Debian" default>

```bash
curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/wasmcloud/core/script.deb.sh | sudo bash
sudo apt install wash
```

  <TabItem value="fedora" label="Fedora">

```bash
curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/wasmcloud/core/script.rpm.sh | sudo bash
sudo dnf install wash
```

  <TabItem value="snap" label="Snap">

```bash
snap install wash --devmode --edge
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="mac" label="MacOS">

```bash
brew tap wasmcloud/wasmcloud
brew install wash
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">

```powershell
choco install wash
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="rust" label="Rust">

If your platform isn't listed, `wash` can be installed with `cargo` and a properly installed Rust toolchain.

```bash
cargo install wash-cli
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="source" label="Source">

The [wash](https://github.com/wasmcloud/wash) repository is open source on GitHub and can be cloned and built locally directly. With a Rust toolchain, `wash` is easy to build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wasmcloud/wash.git
cd wash
cargo build --release
./target/release/wash
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="docker" label="Docker Compose">

:::caution
If you only use Docker Compose without installing `wash`, you'll only be able to interact with wasmCloud via the Web Dashboard.
:::

Download the [sample Docker Compose file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wasmCloud/examples/main/docker/docker-compose.yml) and put it into your work directory.
This compose file will run NATS, a local OCI registry, a Redis container, Grafana and Tempo for OTEL tracing, and the `wasmcloud_host` container. In this format it's easy to run all the necessary services for a wasmCloud host with only a docker installation.

With the `docker-compose.yml` file in the current directory, start the processes with

```bash
docker compose up
```

The host will run until you type ctrl-c or close the terminal window. To start the docker compose process in the background, add a `-d` flag:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

If the wasmCloud host is running in docker in the background, you can view its logs (live) with

```bash
docker logs -f wasmcloud
```

That's it! Let's move on to [Getting started](/docs/getting-started.mdx)

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Once `wash` is installed, simply run `wash up`. This will download and start NATS and wasmCloud for you, printing logs to the terminal. You can exit at any time by pressing `ctrl-c`. Now, you're ready to proceed onto [Getting started](/docs/getting-started.mdx).
