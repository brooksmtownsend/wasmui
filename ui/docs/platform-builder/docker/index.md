Running the wasmCloud host runtime from a docker image is nearly as easy as running it locally. For more information on the docker image and how to use it, please see the official [wasmCloud at docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/wasmcloud/wasmcloud_host), or view the [Install with docker](/docs/reference/alternate-install-methods/install-with-docker.md) installation guide.
